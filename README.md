The project involves active speakers inspired by the Tonsil Maestro S. The power amplifier driving the speakers consists of four TDA7294 chips. For the crossover network and sound tone adjustments, a DSP Adau1701 is used. The power supply is sourced from a toroidal transformer, and the section is enhanced with an EMI filter and a soft-start circuit. Additionally, the master speaker features an extra board that controls an OLED display and serves as a Bluetooth audio source.
